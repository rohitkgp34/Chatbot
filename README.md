# Chatbot

**Building a chatbot using conversations from Cornell University's Dataset.
The main features of our model are LSTM cells, a bidirectional dynamic RNN, and decoders with attention**

**The conversations will be cleaned rather extensively to help the model to produce better responses. As part of the cleaning process, punctuation will be removed, rare words will be replaced with "UNK" (our "unknown" token), longer sentences will not be used, and all letters will be in the lowercase.**
